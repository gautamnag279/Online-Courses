1. Network gives you computational ability outside the local device.

2. IOT devices follow the "client server transaction" model":
a) Single server, one or more clients.
b) Server provides a service for clients
c) Servers manages a resource
d) Server responds to request from the client

3. There are even types of networks:
a) LAN - This is the "local area network" and only hosts a few devices at a time.
b) WAN - This is the "wide area network" and the best example is the internet.
c) MANET - This stands for "Mobile Ad Hoc Network" and is a wireless connnection built from mobile devices. This is very 'range sensitive' i.e. if you start walking away from the source the network will disconnect.

4. WAN is a combination of many LANs.

5. An IP(internet protocol) provides a naming scheme:
a) It defines a uniformformat for host platform.
b) Each host is assigned at leastone of these unique internet addresses.
c) No traffic jam on a router, so the data is continiously split into different routers o enable effecient traffic flow.
d) This division of tasks is done in differet layers. For instance, outing is done in a different layer, arbitation is done in a different layer. 

6. Encapsulation is seperating the work on diffrent layers so that one layer only has to deal with the work on its layer and not with the working of the other layers.

7. The networking layers are:
a) TCP/UCP used as a first layer
b) IP is used at the network layer.

8. Then there are protocols that are application specific called "application protocols". Eg. HTTP, SMTP(simple mail transfer protocol)...etc.

9. No matter what type of network connection you have, you need to have an access point to connect to the internet.

10. We don't have to write n entire program for IOT devices. Rather we call library functions often into the prgram to shorten the code and making it more effecient.
