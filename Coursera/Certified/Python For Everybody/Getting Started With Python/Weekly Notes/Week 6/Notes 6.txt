- STORED & REUSED FUNCTION
1. A python function that has a code written below it and is stored using a name. 
2. The reusable pieces of code are called "functions".
3. The function begins with the keyword "def".
4. And then when the particular stored function code is to be re-used again in the code, we remove the keyword and just place the name of the function.
eg.
def squad():
    print("levi")                    {notice that there is an indentation here}

squad()                                {notice that there is no semicolon (:) here}
print("ackerman")            {notice that there is no indentation here}
>>>levi ackerman

2. The "def" function only remembers a functiona nd will only execute it if it is later called back.
eg.
x = 5
print("hello")
def lyrics():
print("mamma, just killed a man")         

print('yo')
>>> hello yo                        {note that since the "def" function is not called, it is not executed}

**********

- MIN & MAX FUNCTION 
1. The "max" function tells us the max value of the character contained within it.
eg. 
big = max("red striped fox")
print(big)
>>> x

big = max("-787")
print(big)
>>> 8

big = max("97")
print(big)
>>> 9

2. The "min" function tells us the min value of the chracters contained within it.
eg. 
small = min("red striped fox")
print(small)
>>> d

small = min("-787")
print(small)
>>> -

small = min("97")
print(small)
>>> 7

3. The "def" function only remembers a function and will only execute it if it is later called back.

**********

- PARAMETERS
1. A parameter is a variable which we use in the function 'definition'. Think of it as being "the alias" of our function. If you want it to be a bit simpler to understand, think of it as being a placeholder for the code.
eg.
def greet(lang):
    if lang == "es":
        print("hola")
    elif lang == "en":
        print("bonjour")
    else :
        print("hello")

greet("en")                       {here the word "en" is transferred to the placeholder "lang". The placeholder value is then executed in the 'def' code and the result is transfered back to "en"}
>>> bonjour
greet("es")
>>> hola
greet("hi")
>>> hello

**********

- RETURN FUNCTION
1. Often times a function will take its arguments, do some calculation and 'return' a value of the function call. This can be achieved by using the "return" function.

2. The "return" statement is also used to stop the function.
eg.
def greet():
    return "hello"
    
print(greet() , "Emily")
>>> hello Emily
print(greet() , "Scarlett")
>>> hello Scarlett
