- CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
1. 'If statement' ends with a colon (:) and the successive code is done after that.
eg.
x = 75
i = input('enter attendance percentage:')
y = int(i)
if(y<x):
    print("you are fucked") 
else:
    print("we'll get you next time")

**********

- CONDITIONAL OPERATORS
Less than (<)
Less than or equal to (<=)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Equal To (==)
Not equal to (!=)

**********

- MULTIWAY CONDITIONAL STATEMENT
eg:
x = 5
if (x<2) :
    print('small')
elif (x<4):
    print('medium')
else :
    print('big')
big

- TRY & EXCEPT STRUCTURE
1. You surround the dangerous section of the code with 'try' and 'except'
2. If the code in 'try' works - the 'except' part is skipped
3. If the code in 'except' works - the 'try' part is skipped

eg (1): 'Try' executes
x = "9"
try:
    y = int(x)
except:
    y = 5    
print("The number is" , y)
The number is 9

eg(2): 'Except' executes
x = "Kimley"
try:
    y = int(x)
except:
    y = 5
print("The number is" , y)
The number is 5
